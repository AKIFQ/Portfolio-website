            My Story
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              My path started with a problem: how do you review AI generated code before it breaks something important? 
              That question led to SAV, a staging system for AI code that's now used at Pace University's AI Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I wondered about real time collaboration with AI models, which became PATIO AI a platform where 
              multiple users can have conversations with different AI models simultaneously. The technical challenge of 
              managing streaming responses across WebSocket connections while maintaining conversation state taught me 
              what production AI systems actually require.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching 700+ students programming concepts while building these systems showed me how to explain complex 
              technical decisions clearly. But the real learning happened when I started analyzing AI model behavior 
              directly mapping emotional and manipulative patterns in neural activations to understand how these systems actually reason.
